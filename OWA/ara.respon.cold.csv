Gene:2011343	AT1G35720	AT1G35720.1	protein_coding	Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Gene:2168072	AT5G59820	AT5G59820.1	protein_coding	Encodes a zinc finger protein involved in high light and cold acclimation. Overexpression of this putative transcription factor increases the expression level of 9 cold-responsive genes and represses the expression level of 15 cold-responsive genes, including CBF genes. Also, lines overexpressing this gene exhibits a small but reproducible increase in freeze tolerance. Because of the repression of the CBF genes by the overexpression of this gene, the authors speculate that this gene may be involved in negative regulatory circuit of the CBF pathway. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Recombinant PCaP1 interacts strongly with phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) and  PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, and weakly with PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5). It also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. CaM does not interfere with PCaP1 membrane localization but does weaken interactions between it and the PtdInsPs. PCaP1 has an apparent Kd of 10 uM for Cu2+ and can bind six ions per protein. Transcript levels for PCaP1 first fall and then rise following exposure to CuCl2.

Gene:1005714214	AT4G20260	AT4G20260.2	protein_coding	Encodes a Ca2+ and Cu2+ binding protein. N-terminal myristylation on glycine 2 appears to enable it to associate tightly with the plasma membrane. Recombinant PCaP1 interacts strongly with phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) and  PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, and weakly with PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5). It also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. CaM does not interfere with PCaP1 membrane localization but does weaken interactions between it and the PtdInsPs. PCaP1 has an apparent Kd of 10 uM for Cu2+ and can bind six ions per protein. Transcript levels for PCaP1 first fall and then rise following exposure to CuCl2. Mannitol, sorbitol, and the flg22 oligopeptide also increase expression levels. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Gene:2120401	AT4G20260	AT4G20260.1	protein_coding	Encodes a Ca2+ and Cu2+ binding protein. N-terminal myristylation on glycine 2 appears to enable it to associate tightly with the plasma membrane. Recombinant PCaP1 interacts strongly with phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) and  PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, and weakly with PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5). It also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. CaM does not interfere with PCaP1 membrane localization but does weaken interactions between it and the PtdInsPs. PCaP1 has an apparent Kd of 10 uM for Cu2+ and can bind six ions per protein. Transcript levels for PCaP1 first fall and then rise following exposure to CuCl2. Mannitol, sorbitol, and the flg22 oligopeptide also increase expression levels. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Loss of function mutations have increased H2O2 levels and increased H2O2  sensitivity. Mutants accumulate more toxic ions yet show decreased sensitivity to Li+. This decreased sensitivity is most likely due to an insensitivity to ethylene.  Note that in Queval et al.

Gene:6530297459	AT4G20260	AT4G20260.5	protein_coding	Encodes a Ca2+ and Cu2+ binding protein. N-terminal myristylation on glycine 2 appears to enable it to associate tightly with the plasma membrane. Recombinant PCaP1 interacts strongly with phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) and  PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, and weakly with PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5). It also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. CaM does not interfere with PCaP1 membrane localization but does weaken interactions between it and the PtdInsPs. PCaP1 has an apparent Kd of 10 uM for Cu2+ and can bind six ions per protein. Transcript levels for PCaP1 first fall and then rise following exposure to CuCl2. Mannitol, sorbitol, and the flg22 oligopeptide also increase expression levels. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
