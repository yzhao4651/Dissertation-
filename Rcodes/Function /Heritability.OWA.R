####function heritability to get heritability for each variable 
####out_start: the first variable, 
####out_end: the last variable
####heritablity for all of the varialbes 

### this one help me to get which variables has more missing values and help to set up 
###the condition should larger then 900, or other number 
### in the function Heritability 
#out_start <- 4

  #t <-cbind(colnames(normadata[i]),sum(is.na(normadata[normadata$Year==2017 | normadata$Year==2018,][i])))
  #print(t)
#}

## Note from Lindsay: Right now you have two identically named functions, with
## very similar code.  If you have to fix something in one function, you have 
## to fix it in both, which leaves a lot of room for error in the future. It
## would be better to consolidate this into one function, perhaps with a 
## logical argument to control behavior, like

# heritability <- function(out_start,out_end,y, include_year = TRUE){
# ...
# if(!include_year || sum(is.na(y[y$Year==2017 | y$Year==2018,][i])) >= 900){ # see addtl edit below
# ...

## I think previously we loaded this function into another script using `source`.
## Since you have added actual data analysis to this script, in addition to the
## function definition(s), you probably do not want to load it with `source` 
## any more.

## The code `y$Year==2017 | y$Year==2018` seems unnecessary, since it evaluates
## to TRUE for every line of the data frame.  Are you instead trying to find
## traits that were only measured in one year?  If so, maybe do:

# all(is.na(y[y$Year == "2017", i])) || all(is.na(y[y$Year == "2018", i]))
